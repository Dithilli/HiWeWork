"""
hiwe2.py is a "hello world" micro webservice that creates a Bottle micro-framework for web applications,
and then responds with "Hello WeWork ang greetings from Name", where name is either default, or set by the user using
an environment variable, or a command line argument.

It also outputs to STDOUT a log that contains the date and time, the endpoint reached, and the http status code.
"""


import os, sys
from datetime import datetime
from bottle import Bottle, route, run, response, request

"""
Function namer first creates the variable name, and then checks to see if there's a command line argument setting name.
If not, it checks for an environment variable that sets the variable 'name'. If not, it sets the default to "David".

Considered using ArgParse for inputting command line arguments, but this just didn't need it. 
"""
def namer():
    name = None
    if name == None and len(sys.argv) > 1:
        name = sys.argv[1]
    if name == None:
        name = os.getenv('name')
    if name == None:
        name = "David"
    return name

"""
Function logger creates three variables (code, time, and endpoint) and populates them with information pulled from
the datetime module, or from the http response object or request object
"""
def logger():
    code = str(response.status)
    time = str(datetime.now())
    endpoint = str(request.fullpath)
    printout = (time + "- Got a request to " + endpoint + "endpoint. Replied with code" + code)
    return printout

"""
So, Bubble has terrible documentation. Should have used Flask. Thought about it, compared them, thought it would be
simpler for a small project to use Bubble. Learned my lesson.
